- **THEN** the controller logs the error
- **THEN** the controller returns the error to trigger retry

### Requirement: Controller registers with manager
The controller SHALL register with the controller-runtime manager and configure appropriate watches, including watches for Deployments to trigger status updates.

#### Scenario: Controller registered with manager
- **WHEN** the controller's SetupWithManager is called
- **THEN** the controller registers to watch Claw resources as the primary resource
- **THEN** the controller registers to own ConfigMap resources
- **THEN** the controller registers to own PersistentVolumeClaim resources
- **THEN** the controller registers to own Deployment resources
- **THEN** the controller is named "claw" for identification

#### Scenario: Deployment changes trigger reconciliation
- **WHEN** a Deployment owned by an Claw instance changes status
- **THEN** the controller reconciliation loop SHALL be triggered
- **THEN** the controller SHALL update Claw status conditions based on new Deployment status

### Requirement: Controller has RBAC permissions
The controller SHALL have necessary RBAC permissions defined via kubebuilder annotations, including permissions to read Deployment status and update Claw status.

#### Scenario: Claw resource permissions
- **WHEN** the controller is deployed
- **THEN** RBAC rules grant get, list, and watch permissions for Claw resources

#### Scenario: Claw status permissions
- **WHEN** the controller is deployed
- **THEN** RBAC rules grant update and patch permissions for Claw/status subresource

- **THEN** the controller SHALL log the status update error
- **THEN** the controller SHALL return an error to trigger retry
- **THEN** the next reconciliation SHALL re-attempt status update

### Requirement: Controller reads Deployment status conditions
The controller SHALL read the Available condition from both claw and openclaw-proxy Deployment resources to determine overall readiness.

#### Scenario: Get claw Deployment

- **THEN** if Deployment is not found, controller SHALL treat it as not ready

#### Scenario: Parse Available condition from Deployment
- **WHEN** Deployment is fetched successfully
- **THEN** the controller SHALL search deployment.Status.Conditions for condition with Type="Available"
- **THEN** if condition is found and Status="True", deployment is considered ready
